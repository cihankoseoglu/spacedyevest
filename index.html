            <div class="blog-post-body">
              I don't have a lot of time left in this world
Nothing we do, nothing we fight for matters anymore
I can't find a way to hold myself together
A heart, made of glass, shattered in motion
Every song I write, everything is about a different woman
Every woman who touched like silk, who left a crackle in the glass
For every woman who got engaged and married
For every woman who left eventually
And for those who stayed to get their eventual heartbreak
Those that let me go
Those I let myself
I have loved you all dearly
And I did love you all

Yet I see clearly, freed from the blindness
I see your face, through the blankness
I see you for what you are
I can't stop myself from touching your face and holding your hand
As I see another one in this world made of myself
Left with the glass fragments
Little pieces, still in there, hurting everytime you move
Everytime you look, everytime you feel
I see a woman that weeps with me
I see a woman who doesn't even know, still blind

And I want to hold your hand, take you above the clouds,
Below the ground, to the light in the horizon, where I left myself
I want to hold you and smell your hair
I want to hold you and never let go
I want to force you to listen to my sad songs
I want you to feel every single one of them
I want you to feel like I do
Left with pieces of glass, yet freed from the lies
I want you to open your eyes and see what I see
See that I can be there with you
See that there's more to this world before we leave

More than the random encounters we always feel
More than the jade blossom
More than the white armies of hope
And I see in my dreams
The times we weep, you and me
Together, holding you in my arms, in our bed
As you cry your sorrows
And I feel your wet tears
As your pale skin goes red
I wish you were real and not in my head
What you are is just another idea I can't exercise
I wish I could feel your wet tears
I wish you were actually here, so
I will be there, telling you always
We have no more time left in this world
But we will leave together
